Things To Do
(Ideas that may or may not be implemented)

- Allow for the URL to use a placeholder like "$VERSION$" that will substitute the version on export.
- A command line utility that will let you read or update the admin file and export the UpdateInformation.html file.
- Ability to use Markdown instead of HTML to create the release notes.
